One of my first apps with Ionic 1. This is an example with a list of doctors separated by their specialties. Simple transitions, simulated API.

## Getting Started
I wasn't used to git the day I developed this so I didn't use any branch or the commit system. Shame on me, yeah.

* Make sure you have [ionic](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) installed;
* Clone the project to your machine;
* Open terminal at the root folder and run ```npm install```.

## Deployment
**WEB:**
* Run ```ionic serve``` to make the app open at your navigator.
* Check your terminal if anything goes wrong. This should be enough to run.

**DEVICE:**
* Plug in your device with an USB;
* Make sure to set up the needed device configuration. [How to do](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html#developer-device-options)
* Run ```ionic cordova platform add android``` to add the platforms folder[or check here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying/)
* Run ```ionic cordova run android --device```
* Check your terminal if anything goes wrong. This should be enough to run.
